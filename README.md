# vbastock-analysis
Performing analysis on green stock data to uncover trends



Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).

Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general (3 pt).
One of the disadvantages of refractoring code for the particular application of analyzing thousands of stocks is that the program may take a long time to execute. You can easily make this to your advantage if you're well educated in economics and you have tailored the code to a limited stock pool.

There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?


## Overview of Project
This weeks challenge helps us build upon our skills learned in the VBA module. The client wants to do a do research for 
## Results
The analysis had two part task. First, a solution code was refractored to loop through all stock data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, it was determined if whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster, the results shown below.

The most difficult thing for these tasks was making sure that you were filtering for what was being asked. For me, I had trouble, initially, filtering the correct data from the required 'subcategories' when doing the countif function. I overcame this following the tutorials in the module 1 to get the correct Outcomes based on Goal graphs.

## Summary
Based on the results of the 

The limitations of this dataset is that it only provides a small dataset. This script doesn't do a good job of testing its limits. I was curious to know how long it would take to run the S&P 500.
